	 	<p> Since its first light in 2000, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
	 		(<a href="sdss.org">SDSS</a>) has been accumulating the spectra
	 		of quasars of redshift  0.05 < z< 5.8 and to a depth of <em>r < 22</em>.

	 		As the light from these quasars travels billions of light years 
	 		to reach our telescope, it is absorbed by gas in foreground galaxies 
	 		and the intergalactic medium along the way. 

	 		By mapping and studying the absorption features in 
	 		spectroscopic quasar surveys we can better understand 
	 		how gas and dust  in the Universe has evolved 
	 		over the last 10 Billion years.

 	<p> We have undertaken a census of metal absorption lines in the 
 		<a href="http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/products/value_added/qsocat_dr7.html">
 			DR7 SDSS quasar sample </a> 
 			(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....139.2360S">
			Schnieder et al. (2010) </a>).

        These absorption lines are grouped into "systems," 
        	groups of ions appearing at the same redshift.
		Please see York et al. (2015) for complete details.

 	<p> This website provides access to the absorption line system (QSOALS) catalog and quasar spectra,
 	 both the SDSS reduced spectra and continuum-normalized spectra convenient for absorption line studies.
